# 🤝 GitHub Collaboration Guide

This guide will walk you through the basic steps of **forking a repository**, **committing changes**, and **pushing those changes** to collaborate on a project. Perfect for beginners!

---

## 📌 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to the original repository you want to collaborate on.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the page.
3. GitHub will create a **copy** of the repository in your own account.

---

## 📥 2. Clone the Forked Repository

To work on the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
cd REPO-NAME
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPO-NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Make Changes

Edit the files as needed using a code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Example: If you modified a `README.md` file, you’re ready to save and commit it.

---

## 💾 4. Commit Your Changes

After editing, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

> 💡 Tip: Always write clear and meaningful commit messages!

---

## 🚀 5. Push Changes to Your Fork

Send your changes to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push origin main
```

> 🔄 If you're using a branch other than `main`, replace `main` with your branch name.

---

## 📢 6. Create a Pull Request (Optional)

To contribute your changes back to the **original repo**:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click **"Contribute"** → **"Open Pull Request"**.
3. Review your changes, then click **"Create Pull Request"**.

---

## ✅ Done!

You're now collaborating using GitHub! 🎉  
Feel free to repeat the process to continue contributing.
